Flow 

	cli

	Docker Daemon

	containerd

	runc

	containers

cli:

	this is command line interface (docker) that we used to interact with docker

	send commands to docker ( ex. docker ps )

	communication happen via RESTapi, UNIX socket or network

Docker Daemon :

	the background service that manages docker object like (images, containers, volumes and network)

	Receives commands from the CLI and orchestrates container operations.

	Delegates container lifecycle tasks to containerd.

	-> Docker Daemon → containerd

		The Docker Daemon is the high-level orchestrator. It doesn’t directly create containers anymore.
		Instead, it instructs containerd to perform all container lifecycle operations.

	
Containerd:

	A container runtime that handles the heavy lifting of container lifecycle:

		Pulling images from registries
		Managing storage
		Running containers

	Acts as an abstraction layer between Docker and the low-level runtime.

	Uses runc to create containers based on OCI specifications.


runc:

	runc is a low-level container runtime.

	It is OCI-compliant (Open Container Initiative), meaning it follows industry standards for container creation.

	It is responsible for actually creating and running containers on the host system.

	containerd delegates the final step of container creation to runc.
	
	runc uses Linux kernel features like:

		Namespaces (for isolation)
		cgroups (for resource limits)
		Capabilities (for security)

Key Responsibilities

	Create Containers

		Applies OCI configuration to set up the container environment.

	Start Container Process

		Executes the application inside the container.

	Apply Isolation

		Ensures the container is isolated from the host and other containers.


Docker CLI → Docker Daemon → containerd → runc → Containers


Docker CLI: User commands.
Docker Daemon: Orchestrates.
containerd: Manages lifecycle.
runc: Creates and runs containers.
Containers: Final running environment.
